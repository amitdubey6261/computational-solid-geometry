# Computational Solid Geometry 🚀

![Home Screen](./public/Doc/homeScreen.png)

**Computational Solid Geometry** is a project that enables slicing of solid geometries created with Three.js. CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) operations are powered by the **three-mesh-bvh-csg** library, while slicing is performed interactively using a **cutting plane**.

## Tech for Real-Time Rendering

**WebGL 2.0** – The primary rendering API used in this project, providing access to GPU-accelerated graphics within the browser.

**Three.js** – A powerful and widely-used JavaScript library for 3D graphics, simplifying the process of creating and rendering 3D scenes in the browser. Three.js serves as the core framework for rendering geometries and GLTF models.

## How to Use

1. **Open the project in a browser.**

2. **Select an element** by clicking on it. The selected mesh will change its color.

3. **Use orbit controls** to rotate the 3D scene and find your preferred angle for slicing.

4. **Create a cutting plane** by holding the Control key and dragging the mouse.

5. **Undo a cutting plane** by pressing the "X" key if you're not satisfied with the result.

6. **Slice the mesh** into two parts by pressing the "C" key.

7. **Select and move separated meshes independently.**

8. **Load GLTF models** by dragging files from your local file explorer. This repository includes sample GLTF models from the [KhronosGroup GLTF Sample Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/main/2.0).
